## Still to do:

#### Room suggestions:

- Get front end to talk to back end
- Make functions in back end which generate the best suggestion for the user based on what they've asked for
- Prettify front end more?
- Link to more info when a room is chosen
- Push website to sandbox

#### Usage over time:

- Get database for storing info working
- Set up automatic database input every 15 minutes
- Create basic graph using this info
- Finish basic 3D model of library
- Change colour of floors based on how busy they were over time
- Add usage view to website

#### Long term plans (which we could start investigating if we finish the rest):

- Include tutorial rooms in suggestions
- Add ability to book tutorial rooms through website
- Include tutorial rooms in stored database
- Create 2D map of usage over time
- Create 3D models of more buildings
