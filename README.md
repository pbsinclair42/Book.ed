## Still to do:

#### Room suggestions:

- Make more functions in back end which generate the best suggestion for the user based on what they've asked for
- Push website to sandbox

#### Visualisations:

- Fix HTML/CSS of 3D visualisation on website
- Add graph to main website
- Add slider to allow you to view historic data on library as well as current

#### Other:

- Go to bed

#### Long term plans (which we could start investigating if we finish the rest):

- Create 2D heatmap of availability
- Include tutorial rooms in suggestions
- Add ability to book tutorial rooms through website
- Include tutorial rooms in stored database
- Create 3D models of more buildings
